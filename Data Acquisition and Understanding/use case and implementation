# usecase and implementation

* The VGG net is used in many deep learning image classification problems; 

* Smaller network architectures are often more desirable (such as SqueezeNet, GoogLeNet, etc.). It is a great building block for learning purpose as it is easy to implement.

Unfortunately, there are two major drawbacks with VGGNet:

* It is painfully slow to train.

* The network architecture weights themselves are quite large. This makes deploying VGG a tiresome task.
