# data cleaning and processing

* images have different approach when it comes to data cleaning and processing.

* Here steps would include the validation of the URL using requests library

* resizing an image

* using numpy to convert the image into an array

* Shape of the image while storing it (image format) done using openCV library

* Basically most of the cleaning would involve decoding an image and converting it to a numpy array of a the desired shape.

* the traditional EDA and cleaning done on table/database/csv/numerical/categorical data does not apply.
