# Business Understanding and Problem Definition for Image Search/Image Classifier

1) Using Machine Learning Algorithms that will recognize scenes and objects in images to save time and effort.
2) Providing the Convenience of image search to improve user experience.
3) Image pre-processing and storage in a required size and format to train the model.
4) Large dataset with enough variance to capture characteristics of each category.
5) Leveraging the existing libraries in Deep learning (Keras, TensorFlow, ImageAI) for image recognition.
6) Tuning the model for accuracy and consistency.
